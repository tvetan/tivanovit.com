Recently I had a problem with the Sitefinity search because it was
showing wrong search results. And to find what
exactly is being indexed, I followed these steps.

1. Create a **CustomPageInboundPipe** extending PageInboundPipe:

#### **`CustomPageInboundPipe.cs`**

```java
using Telerik.Sitefinity.Abstractions;
using Telerik.Sitefinity.Pages.Model;
using Telerik.Sitefinity.Publishing;
using Telerik.Sitefinity.Publishing.Pipes;

namespace Website
{
    public class CustomPageInboundPipe : PageInboundPipe
    {
        protected override void SetWrapperObjectProperties(WrapperObject wrapperObject, PageNode node)
        {
            base.SetWrapperObjectProperties(wrapperObject, node);
            var title = wrapperObject.GetProperty("Title").ToString();
            if (wrapperObject.HasProperty("Content") && title == "Home")
            {
                var content = wrapperObject.AdditionalProperties["Content"];
                Log.Write(content);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here we are checking for a page that has the title Home. ou can replace it with any problematic page.
And we are writing to the log files the value of the Content property.
It contains the full HTML of the page that is being indexed. Sitefinity logs the value in **App_Data/Sitefinity/Logs/Trace.log**
or you can Debug it and inspect the value.

2. In Global.asax file you can register the new CustomPageInboundPipe

#### **`Global.asax`**

```java
protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Bootstrapper.Initialized +=
        new EventHandler<ExecutedEventArgs>(this.Bootstrapper_Initialized);
}
```

Here we are subscribing to the Initialized event in Sitefinity

```java
private void Bootstrapper_Initialized(object sender, ExecutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.CommandName == "Bootstrapped")
    {
        PublishingSystemFactory.UnregisterPipe(PageInboundPipe.PipeName);
        PublishingSystemFactory.RegisterPipe(PageInboundPipe.PipeName, typeof(CustomPageInboundPipe));
    }
}
```

Here we are Unregistering the original PageInboundPipe and registering our custom implementation.

3. Lastly go to **/Sitefinity/Administration/Search** find your search index and **Actions > Reindex**

If everything was successful when you go to the logs folder you should see the generated **Trace.logs** file with
the indexed content of the page.
